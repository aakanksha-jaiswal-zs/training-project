/*
	Simple Factory:
	A factory function is a function that creates a new object, taking in the parameters required for its construction.
	It works much like a constructor. Factory functions are a better alternatives to initializing instances because,
	the function signature ensures that everyone will supply the required attributes.

	Factories are something that can be easily overused. If you are initializing a struct,
	where the default values in Go are also sensible defaults for you, then a factory isnâ€™t really going to help.

	TIP: Use factory functions to ensure that new instances of structs are constructed with the required arguments
